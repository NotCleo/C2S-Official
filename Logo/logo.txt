    "visual_description": "A circular emblem composed of four segmented arcs that do not touch, forming an implied circle. Inside this ring is a central, solid hexagon (representing silicon crystal structure). Four very thin, precise lines connect the outer arcs to the central hexagon, but they stop just short of touching it, creating tension and negative space. The look is similar to a camera aperture or a high-precision machined part.",
