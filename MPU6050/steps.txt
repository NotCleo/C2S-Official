1) I have a MPU6050 to be interfaced with the Arty-7 100T FPGA
2) I believe here are the variations of tests that can be performed with that sensor
      MPU6050_accel_pitch_roll
      MPU6050_accel_simple
      MPU6050_free_fall
      MPU6050_gyro_pitch_roll_yaw
      MPU6050_gyro_simple
      MPU6050_motion
      MPU6050_temperature
3) In the above list, I require to test MPU6050_accel_pitch_roll and MPU6050_gyro_pitch_roll_yaw (the acceleratometer and gyrometer ICs)
4) I believe both the above tests can be done with a 4 pin interface with i2c, the four pins being
      vcc = 3.3v
      ground = gnd
      sda = i2c data line
      scl = i2c clock line
5) I have attached the mpu6050 register address mapping pdf 
6) I will require a C code to run the following compile commands (assuming that i am doing accel_pitch_roll.c <---> essentially this test -> MPU6050_accel_pitch_roll)

/home/amrut/VEGA/trisul32_buildroot/buildroot/output/host/bin/riscv32-linux-gcc /home/amrut/Downloads/accel_pitch_roll.c -o accel_pitch_roll -static
/home/amrut/VEGA/trisul32_buildroot/buildroot/output/host/bin/riscv32-linux-strip accel_pitch_roll 

7) I have placed the mpu6050 on a breadboard with the pins interfaced according to this iic addresss to the soc's ip directly 

0x1011_6000 -> master bus slave address

8) For reference here's how previously I ran the following code for the camera :
